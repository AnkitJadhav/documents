There are standard libraries available as part of the Tor platform that can convert the level information provided by the sensor to consumption information. The fuel probe has an optional display.
Hour Meter Description The high accuracy run hour meter card can be coupled with any edge gateway and provides an hour count with a 0.02% error. This is meant for use with mechanical engines and earth moving equipment.
Controller Card Description The controller card is meant to provide control along with data acquisition. The card comes with 10 I/Os and a display. The card has an independent power supply with all protections and has a base mounting enclosure.
I/O Expansion Module Description The I/O expansion module provides 10 additional i/os in the following configuration:
•
Analog Input – 4
•
Digital Input – 4
•
Output – 2
